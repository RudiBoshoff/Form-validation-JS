# Form Validation using Javascript

### heroku 
The site is hosted on heroku here: [view site](https://rudiboshoff-form-validation.herokuapp.com/)

### description
A simple form validation using vanilla JS with reuse-ability in mind. The site checks the field on submission as well as on field change in order to give the user a live update.
 
### functionality
The form validation checks: 
  1. if a field is blank
  2. if an email field has a valid email
  3. if a password contains spaces
  4. if a password is a certain length
  5. if a password contains numbers
  6. if a password contains upper and lower case letters

### limitaions
1. The form doesn't submit any information. 
2. The form also does not incorporate github and twitter links below the form. They are just there for eye candy. In a real site the "known" sites would be listed at the top of the sign up form for better conversion rate as users would see the "trusted" links before teh form and are more inclined to sign in using an already known site.
